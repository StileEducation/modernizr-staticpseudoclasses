modernizr-staticpseudoclasses
=============================

A Modernizr test for the WebKit pseudo-classes bug, outlined at http://css-tricks.com/webkit-sibling-bug/

NOTE** The CSS file will needed to be included to make the test work.

Usage:

1) Include the JS and CSS in to the project, after the Modernizr JS file.
2) `Modernizr.staticpseudoclasses` will be true if the browser is affected.
